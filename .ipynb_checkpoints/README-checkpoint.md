![image](application-image.png)

Developing a new currency based on blockchain technology. This is a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)
The process will include using Remix IDE for development, MetaMask for the Transaction and Ganache as the Local BlockChain. 

The steps include:

* Creating the KasieCoin Contract
* Creating the Crowdsale Contract
* Creating the KaseiCoin deployer
* Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local  BlockChain which will be Ganache
